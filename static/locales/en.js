        title: '1. Location',
        description: 'The name "Palmburg" (from German - "Palm City") comes from the name of an estate with agricultural production, located next to the bridge. The owner of the estate grew exotic plants in greenhouses, among which were palms. We are located on the banks of the Pregolya River, in a quiet and picturesque place in our city. On the territory there is a fish restaurant "Skipper" and a yacht club "Marina Palmburg". There is a bus stop 50 m from us.'
